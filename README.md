# Level-Up Bandit Training

A hands-on Linux learning project designed to document my journey through the [OverTheWire Bandit](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/) challenges. This repository serves as both a personal learning journal and a structured guide to mastering Linux fundamentals, including file permissions, shell scripting, networking, and system administration.
